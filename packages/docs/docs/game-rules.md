## Introduction

AuctiOn is a turn-based auction game where players strategically buy and sell items to accumulate as much virtual
currency as possible by the end of the game. Players must balance their inventory, engage in bidding wars, bluff, and
manage their resources effectively.

The game features three types of items:

- **Circle**: Weight 1
- **Triangle**: Weight 1
- **Square**: Weight 1

## Objective & Game Setup

### Objective

Players aim to accumulate the highest amount of virtual coins by the end of the game while meeting specific item
requirements.

### Starting Resources

- Each player starts with a random assortment of items (Squares, Triangles, Circles)
- Total starting item weight: 15
- Starting coins: 50

### Turn Structure

Each turn, one player acts as the "seller," while the others are "buyers." The seller offers a batch of items, revealing
only the total weight.

## Game Mechanics

### Selling Phase

The seller selects a batch of items to sell and announces the total weight. Buyers do not know the exact quantity or
types of items.

**Strategy Tip**: As a seller, consider creating batches that might confuse buyers about the true value.

### Bidding Phase

Each buyer secretly bids a number of coins. The highest bidder wins and receives the items. The seller earns the bid
amount.

**Strategy Tip**: Consider the potential value of the items versus your current inventory needs when bidding.

### Bluffing & Strategy

Sellers can bluff to drive up bids; buyers must decide how much to risk based on limited information.

**Strategy Tip**: Pay attention to other players' bidding patterns to identify when they might be desperate for certain
items.

### Item Requirements

- Players must end the game with at least one item; those with zero items are disqualified from winning.
- Players cannot win if they finish the game with more items than any other player.

**Important Strategy Tip**: Balance your inventory! Too many or too few items will cost you the game.

## Victory Conditions

When all turns are completed, players count their remaining coins. The player with the most coins, who also meets the
item requirements, wins.

**To Win, You Must**:

- Have at least one item
- Not have the most items among all players
- Have the highest number of coins among eligible players
