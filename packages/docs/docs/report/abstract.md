# Abstract

**AuctiOn** is a real-time, multiplayer online platform designed for strategic auction-based gameplay.
Participants engage in competitive sessions initiated within game lobbies.

Each player begins with an initial allocation of virtual items and currency.
The game proceeds through timed rounds where one designated player acts as the **seller**,
offering items for auction.
Concurrently, other players submit bids within the specified time limit.
The highest bidder acquires the auctioned items, transferring the bid amount to the seller.
The system accommodates players rejoining sessions after disconnection.

The primary goal is to maximize accumulated currency by the game's conclusion.
Success requires effective management of resources and strategic bidding.
