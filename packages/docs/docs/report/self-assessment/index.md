# Self-assessment Overview

This section provides an overview of the self-assessment criteria used to evaluate the
AuctiOn platform and its compliance with the requirements.

## Architectural Goals

The platform adheres to microservice principles:

- **Independent Deployment**: Each microservice can be deployed independently
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each microservice has a well-defined responsibility
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through Kafka events
- **Real-Time Performance**: WebSocket connections provide real-time updates to users

## Code Quality

The codebase maintains high quality standards:

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing throughout the codebase
- **ESLint**: Consistent code style and best practices
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns within each service

## Testing Strategy

The AuctiOn platform has been thoroughly tested using various testing methodologies.
For detailed information about the testing approach and results,
please refer to the following sections:

- [Testing Overview](./self-assessment/index): Overview of the testing strategy and tools
- [Coverage Report](./self-assessment/coverage): Detailed test coverage reports for each microservice
- [End-to-End Tests](./self-assessment/e2e-tests): Description of end-to-end test scenarios and implementation

The testing results demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the platform,
with high test coverage across all microservices and successful end-to-end test scenarios.
